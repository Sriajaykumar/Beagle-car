# Beagle-car

INTRODUCTION:

   An RC car is a radio-controlled vehicle that is operated by a remote control. RC cars can be used for racing, stunts, or simply for fun. In this project, we will build an RC car that is controlled by a BeagleBoard. The BeagleBoard is a small, single-board computer that is designed for embedded applications. It is powerful enough to run a variety of software, including the software that we will use to control the RC car.An RC car is a radio-controlled vehicle that is operated by a remote control.

HARDWARE:

The following hardware components are required for this project:  
**•	BeagleBoard
**•	Motor Controller
•	DC motor 
•	Wheels
•	Web cam
•	Battery 
•	USB hub
*Connectors

SOFTWARE :

•	OpenCV library.
•	Python programming language

Software Setup:  

   The Linux operating system is installed on the BeagleBoard. The Python programming language is installed on the BeagleBoard. The OpenCV library is installed on the BeagleBoard.

Software Development:

   A Python program is developed to control the RC car. The program uses the OpenCV library to detect lane lines and adjust the car's steering accordingly. The program also uses the GPIO pins to control the motor controller.

Features and Functionality:

   Explain how the RC car can be controlled remotely, and describe its autonomous navigation capabilities. Discuss the integration of sensors for obstacle detection and other functionalities.

Testing:

   The RC car is tested to make sure that it works properly. The car is driven around a track and the lane lines are detected correctly. The car is also able to steer around obstacles.

Conclusion:

   In this project, we have successfully built an RC car that is controlled by a BeagleBoard. The car is able to detect lane lines and steer around obstacles. This project can be used as a starting point for building more complex RC cars that can perform even more advanced tasks.
